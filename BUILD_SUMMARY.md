# Raspberry Pi Zero W - Yocto Build Summary
Date: May 14, 2025

## Overview
This is a custom Yocto-based Linux distribution built specifically for the Raspberry Pi Zero W. The build uses the Poky reference distribution with the meta-raspberrypi BSP layer and a custom layer for WiFi configuration.

## System Configuration
- **Target Hardware**: Raspberry Pi Zero W (MACHINE = "raspberrypi0-wifi")
- **Distribution**: Poky (standard Yocto reference distribution)
- **Init System**: systemd (replacing sysvinit)
- **Default Target**: multi-user.target (console-based system, no GUI)

## Connectivity Features
- **WiFi**: Enabled with BCM43430 firmware
- **SSH**: Enabled via Dropbear SSH server
- **UART Console**: Enabled for debugging

## Network Configuration
- Pre-configured WiFi connection to "NETIASPOT-2.4GHz-C965" network
- Automatic connection at boot via systemd services
- DHCP client (dhcpcd) enabled for automatic IP address assignment

## Layer Structure
1. **Core Layers**:
   - meta (OpenEmbedded Core)
   - meta-poky (Poky distribution configuration)
   - meta-yocto-bsp (Yocto Project BSP for reference hardware)

2. **Hardware Support Layer**:
   - meta-raspberrypi (BSP layer specific to Raspberry Pi hardware)

3. **Custom Layer**:
   - meta-custom (Custom configurations and recipes)
     - recipes-connectivity/wifi-config (Automatic WiFi setup at boot)

## Build System
- Downloads are cached in the build/downloads directory
- Shared state cache in build/sstate-cache for accelerating builds
- Build output is stored in build/tmp

## Key Software Components
- wpa_supplicant (WiFi client)
- OpenSSH/Dropbear (SSH server)
- dhcpcd (DHCP client)
- Wireless tools (iw, wireless-tools)
- BCM43430 firmware (WiFi chipset support)

## Boot Process
1. Bootloader loads the Linux kernel
2. systemd initializes the system
3. Network interfaces are brought up
4. wpa_supplicant connects to the configured WiFi network
5. dhcpcd obtains an IP address
6. System reaches multi-user.target, ready for SSH connections

## Development Notes
- Debug features are enabled ("debug-tweaks" in EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES)
- Root SSH access is available for development
- The build includes development statistics (buildstats)

## Security Considerations
- WiFi credentials are stored in plaintext in the image
- Debug features make this build suitable for development but not production
- For production use, credentials should be managed securely or configured at first boot

## How to Extend
To extend this image:
1. Add new recipes to meta-custom layer
2. Modify local.conf to include additional packages via IMAGE_INSTALL
3. Add new features through DISTRO_FEATURES
4. Rebuild using bitbake
